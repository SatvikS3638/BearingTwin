# Project Overview
This project implements a digital twin for a rolling element bearing using vibration data, signal processing, and machine learning to estimate fault severity and visualize health in real time. The system combines feature‑based health indicators, an ML regression model, a Fusion 360 add‑in, and a Raspberry Pi communication pipeline to support predictive maintenance of rotating machinery.
